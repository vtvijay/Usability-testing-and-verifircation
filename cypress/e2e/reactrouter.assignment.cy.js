/**
 * ============================================
 * CYPRESS E2E TESTING ASSIGNMENT
 * React Router Application
 * ============================================
 *
 * OBJECTIVE:
 * Write 10 Cypress E2E tests to verify the functionality of
 * a React Router application with authentication, navigation,
 * nested routes, and protected routes.
 *
 * SETUP:
 * 1. Run the dev server: npm run dev
 * 2. Run JSON server: npm run server (if needed for products API)
 * 3. Run Cypress: npx cypress open
 *
 * USEFUL CYPRESS COMMANDS:
 * - cy.visit(url)           - Navigate to a URL
 * - cy.get(selector)        - Select element(s)
 * - cy.contains(text)       - Find element containing text
 * - cy.click()              - Click an element
 * - cy.should()             - Make an assertion
 * - cy.url()                - Get current URL
 * - { timeout: ms }         - Wait longer for async operations
 *
 * AVAILABLE DATA-TESTID SELECTORS:
 * - "home"              - Home page container
 * - "brandName"         - Company name in nav
 * - "Home_Link"         - Navigation link to Home
 * - "About_Link"        - Navigation link to About
 * - "Product_Link"      - Navigation link to Products
 * - "login_button"      - Login/Logout button
 * - "loader"            - Loading spinner
 * - "mini_switch"       - Sub-navigation in About page
 * - "info"              - Info page container
 * - "offers"            - Offers page container
 * - "items_offers"      - Individual offer items
 * - "items_offers_title"- Offer item titles
 * - "items_offers_price"- Offer item prices
 * - "product_detail_image" - Product detail image
